1. Component Modularity & Organization
   Current State
   The main RehabSearch component contains:
   Filter sidebar (with filter sections and search input)
   Results grid (with selection logic)
   Selected rehabs sidebar view (mini-cards, compare button)
   All state management (filters, selected rehabs, sidebar view) is in the top-level component.
   Helper subcomponents (e.g., SelectedRehabCard, FilterSection) are defined inline.
   Recommended Modularization
   A. FilterSidebar
   Props:
   filters
   onFilterChange
   searchTerm
   onSearchTermChange
   onToggleView
   selectedCount
   sidebarView
   Why: Encapsulates all filter UI, search input, and the toggle button. Keeps filter logic separate from results/selection logic.
   B. RehabResultsGrid
   Props:
   rehabs
   selectedRehabs
   onSelectRehab
   selectionLimit
   Why: Handles rendering the grid of rehabs, selection checkboxes, and disables logic. Keeps presentation and selection logic together.
   C. SelectedRehabsSidebar
   Props:
   selectedRehabs
   onRemoveRehab
   onCompare
   onToggleView
   Why: Encapsulates the mini-card list, compare button, and empty state. Makes it easy to reuse or move the selected rehabs view.
   D. SelectedRehabCard
   Props:
   rehab
   onRemove
   Why: Already a subcomponent, but should be moved to its own file for clarity and reusability.
   E. FilterSection
   Props:
   title
   options
   selectedOptions
   onChange
   Why: Already a subcomponent, but should be moved to its own file for clarity and reusability.
   F. (Optional) SidebarLayout
   Props:
   sidebar
   main
   Why: If you want to reuse the sidebar+main layout pattern elsewhere.
2. User Experience Improvements
   Current State
   The toggle between filters and selected rehabs is present, but not visually prominent.
   The selection limit is enforced, but not strongly indicated.
   The flow from filtering → selecting → comparing is functional but could be more discoverable.
   Recommendations
   A. Onboarding/Guidance
   Add a short tooltip or banner the first time a user visits, explaining:
   “Filter rehabs, select up to 4, and compare your choices here.”
   Use a subtle animation or highlight on the toggle button when the first rehab is selected.
   B. Visual Cues
   Use a badge or highlight on the “Selected” toggle when there are selected rehabs.
   When the selection limit is reached, show a tooltip or message:
   “You can only select up to 4 rehabs to compare.”
   Consider a progress bar or stepper at the top:
   “Step 1: Filter → Step 2: Select → Step 3: Compare”
   C. Empty States
   In the selected rehabs view, add a call-to-action:
   “No rehabs selected yet. Use the filters to find and select rehabs to compare.”
   D. Accessibility
   Ensure all buttons and toggles are keyboard accessible and have ARIA labels.
   Use focus states and visible outlines for interactive elements.
3. State Management Review
   Current State
   All state (filters, selected rehabs, sidebar view, search term) is managed in the top-level RehabSearch component using React’s useState.
   State is passed down as props to subcomponents.
   Is This Good Enough?
   For a single-page, non-shared context: Yes, this is simple and effective.
   If you want to share selected rehabs or filters across multiple pages/components: Consider using a global state solution.
   Recommendations for Improvement
   A. Context API
   Create a RehabSearchContext to provide selectedRehabs, filters, and handlers.
   This allows any child component (even deeply nested) to access and update state without prop drilling.
   B. URL State Sync
   Sync filters and search term to the URL query string. This allows users to share filtered views and preserves state on refresh.
   C. Persistence
   Optionally, persist selectedRehabs in localStorage or session for returning users.
   D. Type Safety
   Continue using strong types for all rehabs and filter objects.
   Summary Table
   | Area | Current Approach | Recommendation/Upgrade |
   |---------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|
   | Component Structure | All-in-one, some inline | Modularize: Sidebar, Grid, Selected |
   | State Management | useState, top-level | Context API for shared/global state |
   | User Guidance | Toggle, basic feedback | Tooltips, onboarding, progress cues |
   | Accessibility | Basic | Add ARIA, focus, keyboard support |
   | Persistence | None | (Optional) localStorage for selections|
   | URL Sync | None | (Optional) sync filters to URL |
   Conclusion
   Your current implementation is clean and functional for a single-page experience. For a more scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly app:
   Modularize UI into clear, reusable components.
   Use context for state if you need cross-component access.
   Add onboarding, tooltips, and visual cues to guide users through the filter → select → compare flow.
   Consider persistence and URL sync for a more robust experience.
